# Draft:

#### Add VScode to your `$PATH`

Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`), type 'shell command', and run the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command.

Restart the terminal for the new `$PATH` value to take effect.


# Docs Development:
#### Running VScode in background automatically
